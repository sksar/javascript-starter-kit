# Why take on this journey ? What will it achieve in life ?

- Sometimes in life you just let go. And don't want to work hard.
- Sometimes maybe you want to work hard, but you don't know what to do. 
- Sometimes you know what to do, but you don't know how to do it. 
- Sometimes you know how to do it, but you don't know why you do it.

And thus you are stuck in a loop.

This is a journey to break out of that loop.
